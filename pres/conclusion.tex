        \begin{itemize}
                \item Full-core \gls{MSBR} 3-D analysis was performed using the SERPENT 2 Monte Carlo code.
                \item K$_{eff}$ for initial fuel composition is slightly larger than 1 (1.00397) which
                  allows reactor operation from startup to the first online reprocessing cycle.
                \item The neutron flux energy was calculated for the whole \gls{MSBR} core.
                \item The total temperature coefficient is negative, but MTC is negative which has a
                  negligible effect on safety because it is outweighed by the strong, negative FTC.
                \item Simulation results are in a good agreement with Park (MCNP6) model except moderator temperature
                  coefficient.

               This high-fidelity full-core model will be employed for:
               \begin{enumerate}
                \item Depletion simulations using SERPENT 2 capabilities to find the equliblium fuel composition of the \gls{MSBR}.
                \item Initial fuel salt composition and reprocessing parameters (i.e. rates of removing fission products,
                  the rate of refilling thorium) optimization.
                \item Problem-oriented nuclear data libraries generation for multi-physics models of \gls{MSBR} in the
                  MOOSE-based coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics code Moltres \cite{lindsay_arfc/moltres:_2017}.
